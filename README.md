# Q-learning-R-implementation
The Q-learning reinforcement learning agent was developed to solve the given maze. The agent is trained using an an  Îµ-greedy approach. The agent can move left, right, up or down by one block at a time. The reward function is indicated in the maze (F). The agent can be incentivized to reach the target state quicker by employing a penalty of -0.05 if the agent moves into a blank space. Similarly, the agent can be incentivized to reach the target quicker by employing a penalty of -1 if the agent moves into space that has a X.
